    <p>In many parts of the world, achieving and maintaining optimal health and wellbeing which invariably translates to
    healthy and hearty individuals, families and ultimately society appear to have eluded us which explains the general
    deject of various cross sections of our societies.</p>
    <p>In my candid opinion this does not have to be or remain so, at
    least for the individual, if that is his/her preferred option.</p>

    <p>Having ruminated over current realities of our dispensation, I concluded that the most feasible path of making
    healthy hearty individuals, families and ultimately society, is starting from the bottom, the unit of the
    society
    - <b>the individual</b>.</p>

    <p>A good starting platform we considered for achieving this will be the electronic space(the
    internet).</p>

   <p> 
    This birthed the concept of this website. It is meant to act as a stop gap between the patient, who may be unempowered
    and possible health solutions. <b>It is not meant to replace a comprehensive medical assessment of patient's
    complaint(s) and institution of appropriate line of management.</b>
   </p>
   <p>What we are trying to do here is not to take the usuall theoretical approach to having healthy and hearty people,
    rather we wish to adopt realistic, practical and workable options to arrive at the same destination(being healthy
    and
    hearty) which is the desire of the majority if not everybody.</p>
   <p>To start with, most diseases are not curable. Available orthodox medical facilities around the world are not
    addressing the health needs of the majority. This motivated us to making our own contribution at addressing the gap.
   </p>

   <p>Health according to World Health Organization is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not
    merely the absence of disease or infirmity </p>
   <p>In reality, the spectrum of health is a long one consisting at one end, of people who show no obvious sign of
    illness or whose medical condition has not been detected and at the other end of the spectrum, by people with
    terminal illnesses.</p>
   <p>Wherever you fall within this spectrum, this website can be useful to you. Even for the very ill, prevention still
    has a role, either by slowing down or reversing the illness.</p>
